__Description__: "Hoos Around" is a web-based application that serves as a tool for the UVA community. Within "Hoos Around", users can both browse for and create club, social, or other events on a map of Grounds.


### What is Hoos Around

Hoos Around is a web app that allows for students at  University of Virginia to showcase all of the events that are happening on and around Grounds. Because so many emails and flyers and posts go out each day about events on Grounds, we built this app to help students visualize these events so they can better plan their weeks and weekends. It also serves to simply show all the events that are happening in one place, as opposed to the multiple mediums students typically receive them in. This project was built for the CS 3240 class semester-long project by the students above. 

### How to use Hoos Around

Welcome to Hoos Around. This is a web app that allows users see and submit events for things that are going on around Grounds. This is how it works:

1. Users submit events with lots of different factors to describe that event, such as time, date, and location. They do this in the create events page.  
2. Admin approve or deny these events. 
3. Other users find these events on the view events page.

Users can find all the events they have submitted under the "Your Submitted Events" page.
